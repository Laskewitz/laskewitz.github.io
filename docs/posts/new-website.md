# New website

From today on, I will write my new blogs on this new website. Hopefully you'll like what I have to say! What can you expect from me?

<!-- more -->

## :rocket: What can you expect from me?

My website consists of the following parts:

- Blogs
- Events
- Power Platform Connectors
- About

First of all, I will post occasionally on topics that interest me, like: custom connectors, pcf components, ALM, administration and more.

### :material-typewriter: Blogs

The posts on this website will mostly support my videos on my [:material-youtube: YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/daniellaskewitz). I will try as much as possible to post the posts in the same time frame as the videos, but it might be that one could arrive a little bit earlier than the other.

When I am using code samples in my videos, I will add those to the accompanying post as well, so that you can easily reuse those and try it out on your own environment.

### :calendar: Events

On a different part of the website, I will post about the events I will speak at as well. When available, I will share my deck there. Or if there's a recording - it will be shared as well.

### :material-connection: Power Platform Connectors

The Power Platform Connectors section, is about one of my favorite topics: custom connectors. On this page, I will highlight my VS Code Extension and the Independent Publisher Connectors that I have built.

### :question: About

The about section is about me. It will have some links, as well as some personal info.
