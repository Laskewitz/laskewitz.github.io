# New website

From today on, I will write my new blogs on this new website. Hopefully you'll like what I have to say! What can you expect from me?

## What can you expect from me?

First of all, I will post occasionally on topics that interest me, like: custom connectors, pcf components, ALM, administration and more.

The posts on this website will mostly support my videos on my [:material-youtube: YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/daniellaskewitz). I will try as much as possible to post the posts in the same time frame as the videos, but it might be that one could arrive a little bit earlier than the other.

When I am using code samples in my videos, I will add those to the accompanying post as well, so that you can easily reuse those and try it out on your own environment.
