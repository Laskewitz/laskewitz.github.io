# Blog support just landed

**Hey there! You're looking at our new blog, built with the brand new
[built-in blog plugin]. With this plugin, you can easily build a blog alongside
your documentation or standalone.**

Proper support for blogging, as requested by many users over the past few years,
was something that was desperately missing from Material for MkDocs' feature set.
While everybody agreed that blogging support was a blind spot, it was not
obvious whether MkDocs could be extended in a way to allow for blogging as we
know it from [Jekyll] and friends. The [built-in blog plugin] proves that it is,
after all, possible to build a blogging engine on top of MkDocs, in order to
create a technical blog alongside your documentation, or as the main thing.
