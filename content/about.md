ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Daniel Laskewitz and I'm a Developer Advocate at Microsoft.

ðŸš€ I primarily focus on the Power Platform, where I tend to promote the pro-dev scenarios.

ðŸ“º On YouTube, I tend to post videos every once in a while. I'm also a fan of podcasting ðŸŽ™.

ðŸ§  If you want to know more about me, feel free to look at the social profiles on the left and give me a follow.
